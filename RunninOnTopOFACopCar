Fuckin' posers
Yo yo yeah, yo yo yeah, yo yo yeah, yo yo yeah, uh, yeah
Fuckin' posers, it's almost over now, it's almost over now

For all you fuckin' posers, yeah
It's almost over now, it's almost over now

You think the way you live's okay
You think posing will save your day
You think we don't see that you're running
Better call your boys 'cause I'm coming

You can't be me I'm a rock star
I'm rhymin' on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my four four pops far so
It's almost over now, it's almost over now

Guess you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mental or when you see the skies
It's almost over now, Almost over now

You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think that light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, Almost over now

Somethin' on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gon' take it no more
Since it's almost over now, Almost over now

You had plenty of time, there was no rush
But it was your dream to be like us
You're in dreamland so you don't care
And as you wait we're standing there

You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think that life won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now

Somethin' on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gon' take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

It's almost over now, it's almost over now

You don't succeed, 'cause you hesitate
You think we're flyin but we'll levitate
Just be yourself, don't ask us why
'Cause if you don't, I'll make you fly

You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think that life won't be ever lit
Well It's almost over now, almost over now

Somethin' on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gon' take it no more
Since it's almost over now, Almost over now

No one ever really dies
You believe that?
Well if not, for you
It's almost over now, almost over now

No one ever really dies
I'm watching you by star track
Comin' to a theater near you
