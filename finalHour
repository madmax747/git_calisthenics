The sky is white
The end draws near
Our reactions pave the way
with our own permission
with what's place
This is it
The final judgment day

We call down to our friends
We're sorry to see you go
with their souls on fire
they're crying out
We can't stay
to see their tomorrows

For those who chance
what happens when
you're mind is closed to truth
you fight with life
it seems all right
'til the end you'll be removed

We call down to our friends
We're sorry to see you go
with their souls on fire
they're crying out
We can't stay
to see their tomorrows

You are entering the
gates of heaven
you know your place
where it starts

We call down to our friends
We're sorry to see you go
with their souls on fire
they're crying out
We can't stay
to see their tomorrows

wherever you go
he lives in you
he lives in me today
living at home
with God above
to take you with him
to stay

So We call down to our friends
We're sorry to see you go
with their souls on fire
they're crying out
I can't stay
to see their tomorrows
no, no, no oh, yeah!
